# Twitter-Sentiment_Analysis

In this project, we aim to conduct sentiment analysis on Twitter data to gauge public sentiment regarding Pfizer vaccines. Our approach involves utilizing a dataset sourced from Kaggle to develop a machine learning model for this purpose. We will process and analyze tweets collected from Twitter, employing machine learning techniques to categorize them into distinct sentiment categories. The sentiments we intend to identify in this study encompass positive, negative, and neutral sentiments. To enhance the robustness of our analysis, we will explore various classifiers and evaluate their performance to determine which one yields the highest model accuracy.
